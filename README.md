# 📁 File Handling Project (Python)

## 📖 Description
This project is a **menu-driven Python application** for performing common **file handling operations**.  
It uses Python’s built-in libraries `pathlib` and `os` to provide an interactive interface for users to:

- Browse files and folders in the current directory  
- Create new files and write content into them  
- Read and display contents of existing files  
- Update files by renaming, overwriting, or appending new content  
- Delete unwanted files safely  

The goal of this project is to give beginners hands-on practice with **file input/output (I/O) in Python**, while also learning to structure a Python project for real-world use and GitHub hosting.
